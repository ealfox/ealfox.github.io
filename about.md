Hi :3
I usually call myself Eli on the internet because I'm too lazy to type more than 3 characters. I'm a computer science student who has been doing near zero amount of computer science during past year and needed a new fun personal project.

This is my place to write about stuff without all the annoying aspects of modern social sites. There is no algorithm forcing me or other people to see content we don't want to and only makes us angry, no way to interact so far, just a quiet corner of the internet. I don't want your cookies unless you bake me some.

The website is hosted on github and is built using jekyll and my poor knowledge of html, (s)css and whatever else it needs. I started with the defaut Minima template and now I slowly modify it, although my web dev skills are definitely not sufficient and sometimes it hurts a lot. But I keep learning from all the mistakes I made here so far and it's still fun, so I guess it is worth it.
