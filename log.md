layout: page
title: Log

I want to use this page for tracking my progress with building the website. I have like, zero time, so it is pretty slow. But since my usage of github is not very systematic, it could be better to write it using human words.

- 2024/08/05: So far I managed to run jekyll (harder than I expected, probably fault of my system), set up the basic website and several minor changes, mostly visual.


- 2024/08/06: I created a layout for a page with posts of a specific category. Also created a simple menu on the Blog page with the topics and its pages. Not all of them exist yet because creating them for a specific topic is something I still gotta do manually. Also I limited the number of recent posts to 5. TODO: some cute menu on the main page, maybe divide the page into two columns?
